            <additionalInfo>An essential dietary requirement, as it aids in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. It is also needed for other functions including red blood cell formation, respiration, antibody production and general well-being. Activation of vitamin B6 and folic acid require riboflavin. Riboflavin has been found to aid in the treatment of eye disorders, e.g. cataracts. It is found naturally in liver, kidneys, eggs, milk but is destroyed upon exposure to light. It is manufactured industrially using yeast or other fermenting organisms, used as a yellow colouring and as vitamin fortification, but is difficult to incorporate into most foods due to poor solubility.  Yellow color, it's a vitamin!!!. </additionalInfo>

Energetically it is more expensive to produce, but is more soluble than E101. The molecule consists mainly of the monosodium salt of the 5'-monophosphate ester of riboflavin dihydrate obtained from chemical action on E101 riboflavin. It is rapidly turned to free riboflavin after ingestion. It is found in many foods for babies and young children as well as jams, milk products and sweets and sugar products.

Artificial red colour used in cherries, strawberries and rhubarb, packet deserts, biscuits, cakes, spreads and pates, processed cooked meat, canned fruit, custard mix, sweets, bakery, snack foods; can cause sensitivity to light and learning difficulties; can increase thyroid hormone levels and lead to hyperthyroidism, was shown to cause thyroid cancer in rats in a study in 1990. Is also used in printing inks, as a biological stain, and for extraction-photometric determination of K, Cd, Pb, Mn, Zn, Ag. It also serves as an adsorption and fluorescent indicator, a dental plaque disclosing agent and a radiopaque medium. It has been suggested that erythrosine may affect thyroid activity due the presence of iodine in the molecule which may be released upon degradation, and that erythrosine may be carcinogenic. Used as an ingredient to kill maggot lava and flies. Banned in January 1990, but not recalled by the US FDA**;  Red color, the HACSG* recommends to avoid it.

            <additionalInfo>Green colour occurs naturally in all plants; Commercially available chlorophyll contains other plant pigments, fatty acids and phosphatides, and maybe other oils, fats and waxes. Chlorophyll is an example of a naturally occurring ionophore. It is a tetradentate ligand that binds to an Mg ion through coordination with nitrogen. Chlorophyll is used as a source of olive/dark-green colour, it is susceptible to fading.Â  Excess can cause a sensitivity to light. Green to olive color, naturally part of man's diet. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>Calcium carbonate occurs naturally. The most common form of calcium carbonate is limestone. Other forms include chalk, marble, corals and calcite. Limestone is a major building material as quick lime (CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) are derived from it. Specially precipitated CaCO3 is extensively used in the paper industry as it adds brightness, opacity, ink receptivity and smoothness to the finished product. Calcium carbonate is also used as a filler in rubbers, latex, paints and enamels, and in plastics, as well as finding use as a mild abrasive in toothpastes and an antacid. High levels of ingestion may result in flatulence, constipation, haemorrhoids and bleeding anal fissures.Â   sometimes used to de-acidify wines and firm canned fruit and veg.; toxic at 'high doses' due to mineral imbalance and many other physical problems such as haemorrhoids, kidney stones, abdominal pain, confused behaviour. Other names: limestone, marble, calcite, chalk. No adverse effects are known. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>Titanium dioxide may be used in food to give opacity. No adverse effects are known, and the compound is chemically inert. The manufacture of paint constitutes the major use of titanium dioxide, but it is also used as a paper coating and as a filler in rubber and plastics. The most common form of titanium dioxide at room temperature is the rutile structure, which is a slightly distorted hcp of O atoms with half octahedral holes filled by Ti atoms. Fine particles may be used to produce high opacity films as titanium dioxide has an exceptionally high refractive index in the visible region. Naturally occurring forms of titanium dioxide are usually impure, hence the sulphate process or the chloride process are normally used to harvest an acceptable purity of compound.  Pollutes waterways. No adverse effects are known. White color, no adverse effects are known. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>New to standards, previously  Banned in other countries. Aluminium is a naturally occurring element, present in a normal healthy diet. It is used in food as a metallic surface coating. There is evidence that aluminium accumulation in body cells could be toxic and linked to Parkinson-type diseases, or that skeletal deformations could occur. Pure aluminium is a silvery-white metal that is capable of taking a high polish, has high thermal and electrical conductivity, has excellent corrosion resistance, is non-magnetic, malleable and ductile. It is the most commonly occurring metal in the earth's crust (8.3% by weight), and as well as being used in the food industry, is also used in the construction and aerospace industries, in aerosol cans and foil.Â Production of Al metal involves the following: (i) extraction, purification and dehydration of bauxite; (ii) the electrolysis of Al2O3 dissolved in molten cryolite.Â   Not currently listed for use in Australia. Avoid it. Suspect of being a neurotoxic hazard and been linked to osteoporosis.  </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>New to standards, previously  Banned in other countries. Silver is used in food to give a metallic surface colour. However prolonged consumption may lead to argyria, a blue-grey skin. The greatest source of silver now is as a by product in the manufacture of non-ferrous metals such as Cu, Pb, Zn. Silver is usually obtained from crushed silver bearing ore. The actual method of recovery from the ore depends on which metal is predominant in the ore but normally ends by electrolysis using one of two techniques, either the Moebius or Thum Balbach systems. Silver is used extensively in the photographic industry, as well as in silverware and jewellery, electrically, for silvering mirrors and in batteries.  Not permitted in Australia prior to 1992. Long regular use can lead to blue-grey skin (this is not dangerous). Avoid it. Not permitted in Australia. </additionalInfo>

If during the fermentation of grapes or other fruits, oxygen is allowed into the container, then bacteria convert the ethanol present into ethanoic acid causing the wine to turn sour. Acetic acid may be synthetically produced using methanol carbonylation, acetaldehyde oxidation, or butane/naphtha oxidation. Pure acetic acid is termed "glacial", and is completely miscible with water.  Other names: ethanoic acid. Acetic acid is strongly corrosive and causes serious burns, as well as being a lachrymator.

            <additionalInfo>Antioxidant, colour and preservative. The body stores little ascorbic acid or vitamin C, so this must be provided on a daily basis in the diet. Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruit, raw cabbage, strawberries and tomatoes. Vitamin C has been shown to prevent scurvy, and is essential for healthy blood vessels, bones, and teeth. Vitamin C also helps form collagen, a protein that holds tissues together. Ascorbic acid is industrially synthesised using a number of different biological techniques. Flour treating agent, 'vitamin C'; may be made synthetically from glucose, naturally occurs in fruit and vegetables; added to products as diverse as cured meat, breakfast cereals, frozen fish and wine. Large doses can cause dental erosion, vomiting, diarrhoea dizziness, and could possibly cause kidney stones if more than 10g is taken. Should be taken under medical advice if suffering from kidney stones, gout or anaemia. Other names: l-ascorbic acid, l,3-ketothreohexuronic acid. Vitamin C. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>Lecithins are also known as phosphatidylcholines, and are examples of phopholipids, or esters of glycerol, where two ester bonds are to fatty acids and the third is to a phosphoric acid derivative. Most commercial lecithin is extracted from soya beans, egg yolks and leguminous seeds, corn or animal resources; non toxic; used to allow combination of oils in margarine, chocolate, mayonnaise, milk powder, potato chips, puddings, breakfast cereals.. Lecithins play important roles in the transmission of nerve impulses as well as fulfilling other biological functions. They are present in all living cells and are significant constituents of nerve and brain tissues. Lecithins are capable of forming micelles in aqueous solution hence are employed in foods as emulsifiers. Egg allergy. Nutritious and non-toxic. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>Neurotoxicity, eye and skin irritant,large doses can lead to adicosis and hypocalcaemia. Orthophosphoric acid can only be obtained pure in the crystalline state and slowly undergoes dehydration to diphosphoric acid. Crystalline phosphoric acid has a hydrogen-bonded layer structure in which each molecule is attached to 6 others. Impure phosphoric acid has its main application in fertilisers, and also in the synthesis of pure phosphoric acid. In turn pure phosphoric acid is used in food, detergents, pharmaceuticals and metal treatment (e.g. pickling, cleaning, rust-proofing, polishing). Car bodies and electrical appliances are all protected against rust and blistering by the presence of a phosphatised undercoat. Phosphoric acid is used in the production of activated carbon, and may be used in soft drinks to give a sour taste. "Thermal" phosphoric acid is made by oxidation of phosphorus in the presence of water vapour whilst "wet" acid is made by treating rock phosphate with sulphuric acid. Phosphoric acid is added to food to enhance the antioxidant effects of other compounds present, and also as an acidity regulator.  Too much in diet leads to loss of calcium in bones and onset of osteoporosis.Â  In fizzy drinks it allows more carbon dioxide concentration without bottle burst.Â  Soft drinks, beer, cheese products, snacks, and most processed foods. Other names: orthophosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is banned in organic food and drinks. Phosphoric acid is a highly acidic ingredient in cola drinks, used to offset the extreme sweetness. The way the kidneys excrete it is by bonding it with calcium taken from the bones, which can then leave the bones porous and brittle, and increase the risk of osteoporosis. A study, published in the Archives of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine in 2000, showed that athletic teenage girls who consume cola drinks have been found to have five times the risk of bone fractures of those athletic girls who do not consume cola drinks. Acceptable Daily Intake: Up to 70 mg/kg body weight. Phosphoric acid and phosphates can normally be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians. Although animal bones are mainly made up of phosphates, commercial phosphate is not made from bones. No known adverse effects. </additionalInfo>

Fibre extracted from seaweed, used as a setting agent.Â  It has recently been linked with cancer because it may become contaminated when ethylene oxide is added to an inferior product, this results in ethylene chlorohydrin forming, a highly carcinogenic compound; linked to toxic hazards, including ulcers and cancer; the most serious concerns relate to degraded carrageenan, which is not a permitted additive; however, native carrageenan, which is used, may become degraded in the gut.

            <additionalInfo>A bacterial exopolysaccharide, prepared commercially by aerobic submerged fermentation from Sphingomonas elodea. Soluble in water, it is used primarily as an alternative to agar as a gelling agent in microbiological culture. Its largest advantages over agar are its almost perfect visual clarity and its strength; it is able to withstand 120 degree Celsius heat, making it especially useful in culturing thermophilic organisms. One needs only approximately half the amount of gellan gum as agar to reach an equivalent gel strength, though the exact texture and quality depends on the concentration of divalent cations present. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>Stomach and mouth irritant - some sources list as possible teratogen. HCl can be prepared commercially by the reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride, or directly by reaction of hydrogen and chlorine gases; the reaction is very exothermic and takes place readily in sunlight or at elevated temperatures. The major use of HCl is in the manufacture of other chemicals, but other principle applications include metal pickling, gelatine, dyestuffs, casein, pharmaceuticals, synthetic rubber and metal chlorides manufacture. Large amounts of hydrochloric acid are used in effluent treatment and for the regeneration of ion exchange resins in water treatment. Produced in the stomach to aid digestion. May have teratogenic properties and may be carcinogenic when mixed with formaldehyde. Safe in small quantities.Â  Mainly for the malting of beer, gelatine manufacture, cornflour.

            <additionalInfo>A naturally occurring sulphur containing amino acid, derived from cystine, that the body needs to produce Glutathione, one of the body's major antioxidants. Natural sources of cysteine include eggs, meat, dairy products and some cereals although it is commercially produced from hair, both animal and human, (which is around 12% cysteine) and feathers. In compound form (E920 and E921) it is used in flour and bakery products (except wholemeal) where it is used as an improving agent and in chicken stock cubes where it is used as a flavour. Diabetics should be aware that there are some reports that it may interfere with insulin and there are anecdotal reports that it can react with monosodium glutamate (E621) in individuals who suffer from the so called Chinese restaurant syndrome, a set of symptoms, including headache, burning sensations, dizziness and disorientation. </additionalInfo>

            <additionalInfo>Quillaia extract is a purified extract of the outer cambium layer of Quillaia Saponaria Molina, or Quillay Bark. The Quillaia tree is native to Peru and Chile, and cultivated in Northern Hindustan. Quillaia bark infusion has good foam capabilities due to the presence of saponin, a non-poisonous, white powder. Saponin is a glucoside which will yield quillaic acid and quillaia-sapotoxin upon decomposure. The latter products are both poisonous irritants, however it is the sapotoxin which foams upon shaking. Quillaic acid is also known as 3,16-dihydroxy-23-oxo-12-oleanen-28-oic acid. Used in the production of foam on non-alcoholic beverages. Use is banned in a number of countries. Used medically as a stimulating expectorant. </additionalInfo>
